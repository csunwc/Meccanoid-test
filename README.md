# Meccanoid-test
Experimental codes to test the arm servos in Meccanoid toy robot using Arduino IDE and Uno board.
* 2 arms (3 servos on each arm)
* In V10 directory, a serial text-to-speech board is added for a fun demo .

Due to the low torque and poor position repeatability of the cheap servos, no further progress is made.
